        Rainbow Goblins are elusive little rascals that leave behind portals to a special level called Whimsydale (not to be confused with other rainbow level, Whimsyshire, accessible via the Plan: Staff of Herding). This is the only way to access the secret level which contains the rarest item in the game, the Cosmic Wings! Farming for this glorious cosmetic has plagued many Diablo 3 players, causing them to give up before earning the ultimate prize. You, however, have come to the right place, as the guide below will teach you everything you need to finally meet the Princess!

        Before you begin, decide if you're going for pure speed or overall value. If your goal is to find the most Rainbow Goblins, then you should farm based on speed. Utilizing this method will not strengthen your character as you'll farm on Normal difficulty and receive minimal items. If you want to make your character stronger while farming, then you should simply do T16 Bounties. This will lower the probability of finding Rainbow Goblins, but you'll be powering up with Bounty Caches and get far more legendaries. Regardless of the option you choose, always farm in Adventure Mode with as many teammates as possible. If you typically play solo or do not have anyone to play with, we recommend joining a Diablo 3 Community dedicated to farming Rainbow Goblins.
